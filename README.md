# **SQL Healthcare Analysis** 

## **Project Summary** <br />
This project involves analyzing a healthcare dataset to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve patient care and operational efficiency. The analysis covers various aspects of data handling, including data cleaning, exploration, aggregation, joins, window functions, data analysis and table creation.

## **Objectives** <br />
1. Data Cleaning: Scripts in this section handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.

2. Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis scripts provide descriptive statistics and initial insights into the dataset.

3. Aggregation: Aggregation scripts summarize data by various dimensions, such as monthly trends and department-wise summaries.

4. Joins: Joining scripts combine data from the main dataset with additional tables to provide a richer dataset for analysis.

5. Window Functions: Advanced analytical scripts use window functions to calculate running totals, moving averages, and other metrics.

6. Data Analysis: Data analysis scripts answer specific business questions, such as identifying high-cost patients and analyzing patient visit trends.

7. Table Schema Creation: Creating table with specified columns and variables. 

## **Key Findings** <br />
- The most common medical condition based on age and health condition is obesity found between the ages of 50-59. Therefore, I suggest bringing more awareness and preventative measures such as diet and exercise with people within this age range.
- The most common medical condition based off gender is arthritis in females and diabetes in males. Therefore, I can suggest that patients regularly perform specific stretches and recommended diet that will help those at high risk.
- There appears to be a spike in medical visits for asthma starting in August. Although a person cannot avoid going outside, reducing the risk of pollen by regularly cleaning, and staying indoors can help lower triggers. In addition, the amount of asthma cases is slightly decreasing which suggests that the treatments for asthma is working.
- The hospitals that had the most visitations are in the order of LLC Smith, Ltd Smith, and Johnson PLC. Therefore, a greater quantity of resources can be allocated to these locations.
- There is a high frequency of readmission rates with those who have diabetes and obesity. I suggest looking into the current treatment plans and seek alternative methods to improve them. 

## **Conclusion** <br />
This project demonstrates comprehensive SQL skills, including data cleaning, exploration, aggregation, joins, window functions, and data analysis. The insights gained from the analysis can help healthcare providers improve patient care and operational efficiency.
