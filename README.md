# SQL-Healthcare-Analysis
SQL Project Overview: Demonstrates advanced database design, optimized queries, data analysis, and security considerations through practical SQL techniques and comprehensive documentation.

**Project Summary**
This project involves analyzing a healthcare dataset to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve patient care and operational efficiency. 
The analysis covers various aspects of data handling, including data cleaning, exploration, aggregation, joins, window functions, and data analysis.

**Objectives**
Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats. <br />
• Data Exploration: Perform descriptive statistics and initial data visualizations to understand the dataset. <br />
• Aggregation: Summarize data by different dimensions to extract meaningful insights.
• Joins: Combine data from multiple tables to enrich the dataset.
• Window Functions: Apply advanced analytical techniques using window functions.
• Data Analysis: Answer specific business questions related to healthcare operations and patient care.

**Key Findings**
Patient Distribution: The majority of patient visits occur in specific months, indicating seasonal trends.
Cost Analysis: The average cost of treatments varies significantly across different departments and patient demographics.
High-Cost Patients: A small group of patients accounts for a disproportionately high total cost, suggesting areas for targeted cost management.

**Project Structure**
1. Data Cleaning
Scripts in this section handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.

2. Data Exploration
Exploratory data analysis scripts provide descriptive statistics and initial insights into the dataset.

3. Aggregation
Aggregation scripts summarize data by various dimensions, such as monthly trends and department-wise summaries.

4. Joins
Joining scripts combine data from the main dataset with additional tables to provide a richer dataset for analysis.

5. Window Functions
Advanced analytical scripts use window functions to calculate running totals, moving averages, and other metrics.

6. Data Analysis
Data analysis scripts answer specific business questions, such as identifying high-cost patients and analyzing patient visit trends.
